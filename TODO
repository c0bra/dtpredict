TODO list for Perl module DateTime::Even::Predict

12/18/2009
* Change trim code so that it uses the truncate() method from DateTime.
* I think we'll need to add the interval_buckets back in
* Is there a way to use import() outside of a BEGIN block so that export tags can be imported?
* Change new() and predict() so options can be globally set in the object and overridden in
  each call to predict().

12/17/2009
* Finish writing up pod so module can be alpha-released on CPAN
* Right now we are trimming off any date-part that is smaller than the smallest bucket we
  have turned on. We need to make it so this is done in the comparisons, rather than
  actually modifying dates we are given.

12/16/2009
* Due to possible DOS attack that can be done through very large duration operations (thousands
  of years in the future, etc), we'll need to add some sort of protection, I think.

??/??/????
* Add a clustering() method so that clustering can be turned on or off whenever
