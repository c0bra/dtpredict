TODO list for Perl module DateTime::Even::Predict

12/17/2009
* Finish writing up pod so module can be alpha-released on CPAN
* Write in hooks to predict() so we can check for stuff like the lunar cycle
* Rewrite arguments for _date_descend so it's less ugly. Needs named options

12/16/2009
* Due to possible DOS attack that can be done through very large duration operations (thousands
  of years in the future, etc), we'll need to add some sort of protection, I think.

??/??/????
* Add a clustering() method so that clustering can be turned on or off whenever
